        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever I fly back to Providence, I use <a href="https://bostonairportcab.com/taxi-reservation.php">Boston Airport Cab</a> to book a car from Boston's Logan Airport to Providence. 
          While I love my experience as a rider, whenever I use the site to make my reservation, the experience is far from seamless.
          I often find myself being confused and sometimes having to restart the reservation process.
        </p>

      <div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1em;">
        <p>
          So thought it would be a valuable UI/UX task to look at the reservation webpage and...
        
          <ol>
            <li> Analyze its usability</li>
            <li>Redesign the webpage with a lo-fi and hi-fi prototype</li>
            <li>Implement a responsive redesign</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>1. Usability Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design,  I identified usability issues that can be addressed in my redesign.

                There is some information that is better left on the Home and About page e.g. TripAdvisor Reviews. User can get confused and find it 
                hard to focus on the information and actions they need.

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>I used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a> Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to see how well the reservation webpage performs. 

          Overall, it is accessible for those who need to use larger text and depend on high contract. The main issues were related to <strong>missing/alternative text for the repeated links and additional text</strong>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        
        <h5>Low-Fidelity (Balsamiq Wireframes 3)</h5>

        <p>The biggest change was the omission of unnecessary information. Users click on the make a reservation link with the intention of making a
          reservation. Therefore in the redesign, I focussed on the form, where users fill select options for their reservation. In this design, the user
           should be able to use the form without additional instruction.  </p>
           <p>If the user is a first time user and therefore wants to learn more about child-seats, vehicles, and stopovers, the menu links are
            accessible at the top of the for further information. With this design, returning users and focus making the booking, and only use
             the menu links if needed. </p>

      <img src="lofi-prototypes/Phone.png" class="phone"/>
      

        <h3>Hi-Fidelity (Figma)</h3>
        <p>The hi-fi prototypes look pretty much like the lo-fi prototypes. I focussed on keeping the colours and look very simple.
          The orange works as an accent colour for the buttons and progress bar. The navy blue works as the main colour.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Responsive Webpage Implementation</h2>
        <p>Using Flex Box and Bootstrap, I was able to implement the redesign of the page in HTML and CSS. You'll notice that in this redesign, the user is able to easily change options without having to restart their reservation. 
        </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From this task, I was able to address the usability issues that I personally found whenever I used BostonAirportCab to book my ride back to Providence. 
      I found usability analysis and prototyping, so valuable in making a stronger usable webpage. As a frequent user, I'd love to see BostonAirportCab implement 
      a design like this so that I can personally enjoy the pleasant user experience that matches up to the great rider experience I have. </p>
