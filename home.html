        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever I fly back to Providence, I use <a href="https://bostonairportcab.com/taxi-reservation.php">Boston Airport Cab</a> to book a car from Boston's Logan Airport to Providence. 
          While I love my experience as a rider, whenever I use the site, the experience is far from seamless.
          I often find myself being confused and sometimes having to restart the reservation process from start.
        </p>

        <p>
          So thought it would be a valuable UI/UX task to look at the reservation webpage and...
        
          <ol>
            <li> Analyze its usability</li>
            <li>Redesign the webpage with a lo-fi and hi-fi prototype</li>
            <li>Implement a responsive redesign</li>
          </ol>
        
        </p>

        <h2>1. Usability Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design,  I identified usability issues that can be addressed in my redesign.

                There is some information that is better left on the Home and About page e.g. TripAdvisor Reviews. User can get confused and find it 
                hard to focus on the information and actions they need.
